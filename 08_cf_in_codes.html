<!-- Few charcters we should never use in our code are <, >, &. These characters are gonna be taken as a 
command rather than just a text as we use <,> in tags and & in numerous other places as we wil see. -->

<!-- So we will character referance for these symbols. -->

<!-- ##EXAMPLE 1 -->

<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title> HTML entities </title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Dont be bound by morals. Never <once in life  &i have thought to just >live by, its always a journey </h1>
    <!-- <h1>Dont be bound by morals. Never < once in life  &i have thought to just > live by, its always a journey </h1> -->
<!-- So if we do the first one then the entire middle paragraph will get cut off from start of < to > and the reason is that
the moment the browser is gonna see a element attached with <, its gonna assume its a tag and hence it will try to
read it but will fail to do so and only when it reaches >, then its gonna start rendering normally. everything in 
between is either a tag or element or a attribute. We can try the second one and not connect any symbol with < but
its just a bad variable we should avoid in general. -->

    <p >A beautiful quote = Life and death is nature’s law. All living beings are equal, and everyone has their right to 
      survive and be killed. There might be royalty and lower beings, but in face of death, a person’s death is no
      different from pig’s, what’s the difference? They’re both dead. 
      
      <br><br> 
      
      Another beautiful quote = Not wanting to be trampled on, there are two ways. One is to become strong, 
      strong until no one dares to step on you. Another is to turn into dog shit, something no one would want to step on

      This quote = He was still expressionless, he continued to move forward relentlessly.
      I had once screamed, gradually, I lost my voice.
      
      I had once cried, gradually, I lost my tears.
      
      I had once grieved, gradually, I became able to withstand everything.
      
      I had once rejoiced, gradually, I became unmoved by the world.
      
      And now!
      
      All I have left is an expressionless face, my gaze is as tough as a monolith, only perseverance remains in my heart.
      
      This is my own, an insignificant character — Perseverance! </p>
