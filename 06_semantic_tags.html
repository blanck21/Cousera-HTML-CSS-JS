<!-- h1 to h6, header, nav, section, article, aside. -->

<!-- The tags which tells a little bit about the content like its importance or a little bit about the content are semantic
tags. For example h1 tag which is basically heading tag, it tells us that whatever is inside the h1 tag is gonna be 
the most inportant heading in the entire HTML document.The semantic HTML tags or element which has inherent meaning. -->

<!-- Now this also helps in understanding the code better for humans as well machines. It MAY also helps with Search engine 
optimization(SEO), this is the work of broswers which gives the sites or contents we need when we seach for something.
It actually rather debatable whether it helps or not but people do it anyway. --> -->

<!-- ##Example 1 -->

<!-- <!doctype html>
<html lanh="fr">
<head>
    <meta charset="urf-8">
    <title>About semantic tags </title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> This is heading 1 </h1>
    <h2> This is heading 2 </h2>
    <h3> This is heading 3 </h3>
    <h4> This is heading 4 </h4>
    <h5> This is heading 5 </h5>
    <h6> This is heading 6 </h6> -->
<!-- Now this does tells us that h1 tag is most important tag and h6 tag is least important tag and all h1 to h6 are visually
different to each other, from largest to smallest.thats the default look of the headings. -->
<!-- But we need to remember that it is no way to do a styling as every h tag means a heading with a proper meaning as it is a
semantic tag and CSS can achieve the same result with minimal effort. h tags should only be used to describe the structure only. -->
<!-- h1 tag is generally the tag containing the content which the entire page is focusing on. -->

<!-- </body>
</html> -->

<!-- ##Example 2 -->

<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Some other HTML tags</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        header tag usually contains some header information and contains some header informtaion about the site such as 
        company logo, tagline and it often contain navigation tag.
        <nav> its short for vavigation and it usually contains links to different parts of the same website.</nav>
    </header>
    <h1>Its the main heading of the website.</h1>
    <section>
        Section1
        <article> This is article 1 </article>
        <article> This is article 2 </article>
        <article> This is article 3 </article>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        Section 2
        <article> This is article 4 </article>
        <article> This is article 5 </article>
        <article> This is article 6 </article>
    </section>
<!-- here article tag is inside the section tag. If we look at HTML5 specification, We will see that the way section tg is defined,
it makes sense that article tag comes inside the section tag but its not set in stone. its possible that section can be inside the
article tag. -->
    
    <aside> This tag usually contains information related to main content but not exactly the main content. </aside>
    <footer> Contains the footer info </footer>            
</body>
</html>

<!-- Now they are all block level elements. But the reason we used so many semnatic tags instead of just a normal tag like div or span, 
it is to make things more understable strcuturely for both user and computer. They inherently convey some meaning -->

<!-- So we should semantic tags when we can but we also needs to understand that while they do give more understanding of codes, 
they dont add anything else to the functionality than a regular div or span. -->
