<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Now this declration was used in past to basically tell the browser that it is a HTML langugae you have to render.
There were some sites which were compliant to browser standards while some didnt, Non compliant pages were rendered in what
we call a quirk mode while compliant pages weere rendered in what we call standards mode. And if we dont use it then the
browser is gonnna take that HTML document as something which doenst follow HTML standards and it can create problems. -->

<html lang="fr">
<!-- HTML tags tells us its the beginning of the code and lang attribute tells the language. -->
<head>
<!-- head tag describes authors description of the page, page title and whatever external resoures are needed to render the html
document. It contains some meta data about the main content. -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- We just told to know what the character set is. It makes codes more sophisticated and UTF-8 is backwards compatible
with ASCII. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages oppose to UTF-16 which we prefer in major operating system 
and enviroment. -->
    <title>For web development video</title>
<!-- title tag is Required tag or HTML would be invalid -->
</head>
<body>
    This is something with no heading and paragraph. hence it is slightly different. 
    <h1>This is something with heading hence it is slightly different from last one</h1>
<!-- Bold character is a common sign. -->
</body>
<!-- body tag is root of all content visible to the user which includes headings and paragraps and break lines etc. We
sometimes call it as a viewport cause of it. -->
</html>
<!-- We should choose to use w3 validator site to check if our site is following the standards of current HTML 5 or not. -->

<!-- So as we can see here that all we are doing is nesting one html tag into another like we we nested title tag in head. One rule
to remember is that we have to close the last opened tag before we close the parent tag. -->
 
<!-- So like Head tag is a parent tag and title tag is children (sort of) so <head> <title></title></head> is correct but if you
dont close the last opened tag which will be title tag here before you close the parent tag which is gonna be head tag then 
the HTML document becomes invalid. It will look something like this btw, <head><title></head></title> so as we can see, we didnt
closed the title tag before we close its parent head tag and hence HTML codes becomes invalid. -->

<!-- Last but not least point is that, HTML code always renders sequencely ane hence the doctype will get rendered first and then the 
HTML tag and head and so on untill it hits the last HTML tag. -->
