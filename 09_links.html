<!-- Internal Links are hyperlinks that point at (target) the same domain as the domain that the link exists 
on (source). In layman's terms, an internal link is one that points to another page on the same website. But since
we didnt provide any directory, its gonna assume the same directory.-->

<!-- " a " tag is both inline and block level tag or both flow and phrase tag. -->
